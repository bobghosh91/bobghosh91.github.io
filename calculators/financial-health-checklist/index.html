                                Can you invest at least 20% of your take-home pay towards these goals? Here again, the higher, the better, but even with EMIs, you should be close to 20% or more.

                                💡 <strong>Note:</strong> The 20% rule is a thumb rule. If you're starting late or have ambitious goals, you may need to save more. If you have EMIs, try to maintain at least 15-20% savings.
