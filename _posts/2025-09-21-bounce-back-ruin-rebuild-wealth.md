                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400">Begin by taking a comprehensive look at your financial situation. List all debts, monthly expenses, and any available assets. This honest assessment will provide clarity and help you understand the full scope of the setback. Use spreadsheets or budgeting apps to track every detail, as having accurate numbers in front of you <span class="font-bold">removes guesswork</span> and creates a solid foundation for your recovery plan.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400">Focus on essential expenses such as housing, food, and utilities. Create a budget that prioritizes these needs while minimizing non-essential spending. This approach can free up resources for debt repayment or savings. Review subscriptions, memberships, and recurring charges that you may have forgotten about, and cancel anything that doesn't serve your immediate needs during this recovery period.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400">Establishing an emergency fund is crucial for protecting against future financial shocks. Aim to save a small amount regularly until you reach a goal, gradually increasing it to cover six to twelve months' worth of expenses.
