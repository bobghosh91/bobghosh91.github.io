    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is a Mutual Fund?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Think of a mutual fund as a large investment pool where you and other investors contribute money together. A professional manager uses this combined money to buy a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Managed by expert asset managers, mutual funds let individual investors access a diverse investment portfolio without having to choose individual securities on their own. This group investment method not only makes a variety of asset classes available to more people but also helps investors save on transaction costs and fees through economies of scale.</p>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What are the Benefits of Investing in Mutual Funds?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Investing in mutual funds offers several advantages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Diversification</strong>: Mutual funds invest in a variety of asset classes, reducing the risk associated with investing in a single asset. This diversification helps to manage the impact of poor performance from any one investment on the overall portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Management</strong>: Fund managers are experienced professionals who make investment decisions on behalf of investors. They conduct thorough research and analysis to identify the best investment opportunities, which can be particularly beneficial for those who lack the time or expertise to manage their investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: Most mutual funds allow investors to redeem their shares at any time, providing easy access to funds. This liquidity is a significant advantage, especially in times of financial need.</li>
            <li><strong>Affordability</strong>: Investors can start with a relatively small amount of money, making mutual funds accessible to a wide range of individuals. Many funds have low minimum investment requirements, allowing even novice investors to participate.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Oversight</strong>: Mutual funds are regulated by government authorities, ensuring transparency and investor protection. This regulatory framework helps to maintain the integrity of the investment process and provides investors with a level of confidence.</li>
        </ol>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">How Mutual Funds Work</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Mutual funds work by gathering money from investors and investing it in a mix of assets. Investors purchase shares in the mutual fund, and the value of these shares varies with the performance of the underlying assets. The fund manager makes investment choices to reach the fund's goals, which can include growth, income, or both. This setup lets investors take advantage of the collective knowledge of the fund management team while reducing their risk across a wider range of investments.</p>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What are the Risks Involved with Investing in a Mutual Fund?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>While mutual funds offer many benefits, they also come with risks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Market Risk</strong>: The value of mutual fund shares can fluctuate based on market conditions. Economic downturns or adverse market events can negatively impact the performance of the fund.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Risk</strong>: If the issuers of the securities in the fund default, it can affect the fund's performance. This risk is particularly relevant for bond funds, where the creditworthiness of issuers is crucial.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest Rate Risk</strong>: Changes in interest rates can impact bond funds significantly. Rising interest rates typically lead to falling bond prices, which can adversely affect the value of bond mutual funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity Risk</strong>: Some funds may have restrictions on redemptions, affecting investors' ability to access their money. This is particularly true for certain types of funds that invest in illiquid assets.</li>
        </ol>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">How Safe is it to Invest in Mutual Funds?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Investing in mutual funds is generally considered safe, especially when compared to investing in individual stocks. Safer than picking individual stocks? Generally, yes. But "safe" is relative. Equity funds (heavy on stocks) are riskier than bond funds, for example. The key is figuring out how much risk you're comfortable with and what you're trying to achieve. Are you saving for retirement 30 years away or buying a house in 3 years? That changes everything. And remember, mutual funds do have regulatory oversight, which adds a layer of protection – but it doesn't eliminate market risk.</p>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">Can Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) Invest in Mutual Funds?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Yes, NRIs can invest in mutual funds in India. They must comply with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations and complete the necessary documentation, including KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. It's a bit of paperwork, but it's totally doable and lets you participate in India's mutual fund market from wherever you are.</p>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is an Asset Management Company?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>An Asset Management Company (AMC) is a firm that manages mutual funds and other investment portfolios on behalf of investors. An AMC is basically the company that runs the mutual fund. AMCs employ professional fund managers who make investment decisions based on the fund's objectives. They are responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund's investments, ensuring that the fund adheres to its stated investment strategy and objectives.</p>
    </div>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is NAV?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>NAV stands for Net Asset Value, and it's basically the price per share of your mutual fund. It's how much one unit of the fund is worth on any given day. When you buy or sell mutual fund shares, you do it at the NAV price. It's super important because it tells you whether your investment is going up or down. Think of it like checking the price tag on something you own.</p>
    </div>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">How Often is the NAV Declared?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>NAV is typically declared on a daily basis for most mutual funds, allowing investors to see the current value of their investments. This daily valuation provides transparency and helps investors make informed decisions regarding their investments.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">How is NAV Calculated?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>The math is actually pretty straightforward:</p>
        <p><strong>NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Total Outstanding units</strong></p>
        <p>They add up the current market value of all the stocks, bonds, and other stuff the fund holds, subtract any debts or expenses, and then divide by the total number of units outstanding. This happens every day based on closing market prices, so your NAV reflects what's happening in the market in real-time.</p>
    </div>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What are the Different Types of Mutual Fund Schemes?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>There's actually a pretty good variety depending on what you're after:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Equity Funds</strong>: These invest mainly in stocks. Higher risk, but potentially higher rewards. Good if you're young and can handle some roller-coaster rides.</li>
            <li><strong>Debt Funds</strong>: These buy bonds and other fixed-income stuff. Steadier and less dramatic, focused on generating regular income.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Funds</strong>: Can't decide? These mix stocks and bonds to balance risk and return. A nice middle ground.</li>
            <li><strong>Index Funds</strong>: These just copy a market index like the Nifty 50. Low maintenance, low fees, and you get whatever the market gives.</li>
            <li><strong>Sector Funds</strong>: Want to bet on tech? Or pharma? These focus on specific industries. More risky because you're not as diversified.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">How Can I Monitor or Track the Performance of Mutual Funds I Have Invested In?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Investors can track the performance of their mutual funds through:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fund Fact Sheets</strong>: Provided by the AMC, these documents offer insights into fund performance, holdings, and management.</li>
            <li><strong>Online Portals</strong>: Many AMCs have online platforms where investors can view their investments and track performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial News Websites</strong>: These platforms provide updates on mutual fund performance and market trends, helping investors stay informed.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">Do I Need to Have a Demat Account to Transact in Mutual Funds?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>No, a Demat account is not required to invest in mutual funds. Investors can purchase mutual fund units directly through the AMC or through a mutual fund distributor without needing a Demat account. This accessibility simplifies the investment process for many individuals.</p>
    </div>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is a New Fund Offer (NFO)?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>An NFO is like the IPO of mutual funds – it's when a brand new fund is launched and you can buy in at the initial offering price before it starts trading normally. Sometimes NFOs can be interesting if the fund has a unique strategy, but don't get too hyped. Just because it's new doesn't automatically make it better than existing funds with proven track records.</p>
    </div>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Dividend / IDCW Option?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>The Dividend or Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) option allows investors to receive periodic payouts from the mutual fund's profits. This option is suitable for those seeking regular income from their investments, providing a steady cash flow.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Growth Option?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>With the Growth option, all profits stay in the fund and get reinvested. You don't get regular payouts, but your investment grows over time through compounding. If you don't need income right now and want to maximize long-term growth, this is typically the way to go. The magic of compounding really shines over 10+ years.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>A SIP is honestly one of the best investment tools out there. You pick an amount – say ₹5,000 – and it automatically gets invested every month (or whatever frequency you choose). It builds discipline because you're investing regularly, and it smooths out market volatility. When prices are high, you buy fewer units. When prices drop, you buy more. It's called rupee cost averaging, and it takes the stress out of timing the market.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>SWP is like the reverse of a SIP. Instead of putting money in regularly, you're taking money out regularly – say ₹10,000 every month. It's perfect for retirees or anyone who needs a steady income stream from their investments. Your remaining money keeps growing while you withdraw, giving you the best of both worlds.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>STP lets you gradually move money from one fund to another within the same AMC. For example, you might transfer from a debt fund to an equity fund bit by bit. It's useful when you want to shift your strategy but don't want to do it all at once. Kind of like testing the waters before diving in completely.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is a Switch?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Switching is when you move your money from one fund to another within the same AMC. Maybe you started in a conservative fund but now you're feeling more adventurous, or vice versa. Most AMCs make this pretty easy – it's like changing lanes while staying on the same highway.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is KYC and How to Get KYC Verified?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is basically the government's way of verifying you are who you say you are. Before you can invest in mutual funds, you need to submit identity proof and address proof. You can do it online through the AMC's website or through authorized agents. Once you're KYC compliant, you're good to go for all your mutual fund investments – you don't have to repeat it for every fund.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">Do Existing Investors Need to Repeat KYC Formalities?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Usually not! Once you're KYC verified, you're set unless something changes – like you move to a new address or your documents expire. If regulators find issues with your KYC, they might ask you to update it, but generally, it's a one-and-done thing.</p>
    </div>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Exit Load?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Exit load is basically a penalty for cashing out too early. Funds charge this (usually 1-2% of your withdrawal) if you redeem within a certain time period – often within a year of investing. It's designed to discourage people from jumping in and out constantly. Always check the exit load before investing so you're not surprised later!</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Redemption Price?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Redemption Price is the price at which an investor can sell their mutual fund units back to the fund. It is usually equal to the NAV of the fund at the time of redemption, minus any applicable exit load. This price reflects the current value of the investor's holdings. So if the NAV is ₹100 and there's a 1% exit load, you'd get ₹99 per unit. Simple as that.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid #5a7aa8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: #1a2838;">
    <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; padding: 10px; background: #2a3f5f; border-radius: 5px; color: #e8f0ff;">What is Repurchase Price?</summary>
    <div style="padding: 15px; margin-top: 10px; background: #152030; color: #d4e1f5;">
        <p>Repurchase Price is the price at which the mutual fund company buys back its units from investors. This price is typically the same as the NAV, minus any exit load. Don't overthink it – these terms are basically interchangeable.</p>
    </div>
